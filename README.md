# improvisedArchitectureDemonstration
A demonstration of the map tools created for Frood Design's Improvised Architecture

This is a demonstration of a mapping system using openlayers. It was originally created by Evan Moring with Frood Designs. 
You can see a full demonstration at frooddesigns.com/improvisedarchitecture.

Add images to new and run the exifGetterNew.py Python program. Make sure these images have GPS metadata or this won't work. 
That will automatically populate the compressed and preview folders with prepared images and the GPSData.json file with GPS data from the photos.
